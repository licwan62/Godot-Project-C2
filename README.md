## Level Design

* This game involves 4 levels set their themes as spring, summer, autumn and winter foreach takes about at least 2 minute gaming required regardless of conversation
* The feature is unlock reaching higher level like gun in ‘Summer’ level left by Warren, grappling hook in world 3 level dropped by guards
Their might be implemented with gun replacement placed in interval stages if the system not growing too complicated for me
* There are points which are fragments to be collected. If all of points in each level collected there will be combined into a picture (showing in Gallery as rewards)

### World 1

* This level is supposed to be simplest one which I am planning to have a guidance showing on screen telling player make some movement and fighting – guide player to jump on a platform, counterattack an attack, beat one enemy there and flash to bypass a laser beam
* I am planning to have some puzzle like Wynn had been locked aside a door and player are supposed to get the key kept by somebody to beaten

### World 2

* This level unlock grappling hook placed on certain platform on the  way where play must get passed 
* There should be some platforms that are inaccessible without using grappling hook to encourage player using the feature
* There are enemies shooting from a high position where player has to hook on ceil and able to shoot them, otherwise they are impossible to damage on
* Point hidden somewhere inaccessible without using hook

### World 3

* This level is not planned to have special event but more base on conversation with Young
* (If time permit) I might implement feature like switching around control on playing role as Young and Lee, doing cooperation to get Young out

### World 4

* This level includes small game to simulate Joe disguising as lady communicating and spamming the targets in social media
* Complete the game by selecting option of words in communication, selecting right will increase the convincing points and in contract, decrease points until lose
* Winning the game will get reward in HP recover and losing will is reverse
